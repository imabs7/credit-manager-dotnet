# ArchitecturePlan.md 
## .NET Architecture Plan for Bank Application 
This document outlines the architecture plan for migrating the existing Java-based Bank application to a .NET-based application, ensuring alignment with .NET best practices. 
### Project Structure 
- **Framework**: ASP.NET Core 
- **Pattern**: MVC (Model-View-Controller) 
- **ORM**: Entity Framework Core 
- **Rendering**: Razor Pages for server-side rendering 
### Key Components 
1. **Controllers**: 
   - Use ASP.NET Core controllers to handle HTTP requests. 
   - Example: `HomeController` for managing home page interactions. 
2. **Services**: 
   - Create service classes to encapsulate business logic. 
   - Example: `CreditService` for managing credit operations. 
3. **Repositories**: 
   - Implement repository pattern for data access. 
   - Example: `CreditRepository` for managing credit data. 
4. **Entities**: 
   - Define entity classes to represent database tables. 
   - Example: `Credit`, `Customer`, `Product` classes. 
5. **DTOs**: 
   - Use Data Transfer Objects for data transfer between layers. 
   - Example: `CreditDto` for transferring credit data. 
6. **Error Handling**: 
   - Implement custom middleware for global error handling to ensure robust error management. 
### Best Practices 
- **Dependency Injection**: 
  - Utilize dependency injection for service and repository classes to promote loose coupling and testability. 
- **Asynchronous Programming**: 
  - Implement asynchronous programming using async/await to improve application responsiveness. 
- **Configuration Management**: 
  - Use configuration files for application settings to separate configuration from code. 
- **Separation of Concerns**: 
  - Ensure clear separation of concerns and modular code organization to enhance maintainability. 
### .NET Technologies and Libraries 
- **ASP.NET Core**: For building the web application. 
- **Entity Framework Core**: For ORM and database interactions. 
- **Razor Pages**: For server-side rendering. 
- **Logging**: Use built-in logging framework for logging application events. 
- **Dependency Injection**: Built-in support in ASP.NET Core. 
### Architectural Patterns 
- **MVC Pattern**: 
  - Adopt the Model-View-Controller pattern to separate application logic, UI, and data handling. 
- **Repository Pattern**: 
  - Implement repository pattern to abstract data access logic and promote a clean architecture. 
### Migration Preparation 
1. **Set Up .NET Development Environment**: 
   - Ensure .NET SDK is installed. 
   - Set up a new ASP.NET Core project using the command line or Visual Studio. 
2. **Create Initial Project Structure**: 
   - Create folders for Controllers, Services, Repositories, Models, DTOs, and Views. 
3. **Create Placeholder Files**: 
   - Create placeholder files for controllers, services, repositories, and models to establish the basic structure. 
### Commands to Run 
1. **Set Up .NET Project**: 
   ```bash 
   dotnet new mvc -n BankApp 
   cd BankApp 
   ``` 
2. **Create Project Structure**: 
   ```bash 
   mkdir Controllers Services Repositories Models DTOs Views 
   ``` 
3. **Create Placeholder Files**: 
   ```bash 
   touch Controllers/HomeController.cs 
   touch Services/CreditService.cs 
   touch Repositories/CreditRepository.cs 
   touch Models/Credit.cs 
   touch DTOs/CreditDto.cs 
   touch Views/Home/Index.cshtml 
   ``` 
This architecture plan provides a comprehensive approach to migrating the current Java application to a .NET application, ensuring adherence to .NET best practices and setting a solid foundation for the migration process.
